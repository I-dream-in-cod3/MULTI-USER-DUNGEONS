  Installing WinTin++

A windows installer is available for download <http://
tintin.mudhalla.net/download.php> to install WinTin++, which exists of
the PuTTY terminal and a TinTin++ binary. Wintin doesn't have shell
capabilities, but otherwise it's an excellent TinTin++ port that works
on Windows 95, 98, XP, Vista, 7, 8 and 10. For an interactive shell see
the instructions for installing TinTin++ on Windows <#Windows>.
 


  Compiling TinTin++

  * wget https://github.com/scandum/tintin/releases/download/2.02.51/
    tintin-2.02.51.tar.gz
  * tar -zxvf tintin-2.02.51.tar.gz
  * cd tt/src
  * ./configure
  * make install
  * tt++

If 'make install' does not work try 'sudo make install'. If you can't
get make install to work launch the program using ./tt++ from the src
directory.
 
If tintin fails to compile you most likely need to install the zlib and/
or pcre libraries. The gnutls library for ssl support is optional.
 


  Snap

If your system supports snap <https://snapcraft.io/tintin> you can
install tintin using 'snap install tintin'.

The following commands should install TinTin++ on Alpine Linux.
 

  * mkdir tintin
  * cd tintin
  * apk update
  * apk upgrade
  * apk add build-base
  * apk add zlib-dev
  * apk add gnutls-dev
  * apk add pcre-dev
  * apk add make
  * apk add wget
  * wget https://github.com/scandum/tintin/releases/download/2.02.51/
    tintin-2.02.51.tar.gz
  * tar -zxvf tintin-2.02.51.tar.gz
  * cd tt/src
  * ./configure
  * make install

 


  Android

The following commands should install TinTin++ on Android.
 

  * Install Termux <https://termux.com/> (an Android terminal emulator
    and Linux environment) using the Termux website (the Google play
    store version works for Android 11+), then enter:
  * apt update
  * apt install tintin++
  * tt++

 
In case Termux doesn't provide the latest version the following commands
should manually install TinTin++.
 

  * apt install make
  * apt install cmake
  * apt install libgnutls
  * apt install pcre
  * apt install wget
  * wget https://github.com/scandum/tintin/releases/download/2.02.51/
    tintin-2.02.51.tar.gz
  * tar -zxvf tintin-2.02.51.tar.gz
  * cd tt/src
  * ./configure
  * make
  * cp tt++ /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/

 
Make sure to read the Termux helpfile on using a touch keyboard
<https://termux.com/touch-keyboard.html> for information about using
control codes. You can, for example, use #macro {\cn} {n} to have
TinTin++ execute 'n' when pressing volume-down and the 'n' key
simultanously. Also checkout the getting started <http://
tintin.mudhalla.net/starting.php#TERMUX> page.
 


  BSD

In order to compile the source code you need to have the zlib and pcre
libraries installed.
 
The following commands should install TinTin++ on OpenBSD 7.4.
 

  * pkg_add pcre
  * wget https://github.com/scandum/tintin/releases/download/2.02.51/
    tintin-2.02.51.tar.gz
  * tar -zxvf tintin-2.02.51.tar.gz
  * cd tt/src
  * ./configure CFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib
  * make CFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib
  * make install

 
If this fails, see if you need to provide different -I and -L values
using these two commands:

  * pcre-config --cflags
  * pcre-config --libs

  * cd tt/src
  * ./configure
  * sudo make install

 
If sudo apt-get build-dep tintin++ fails try installing developer
libraries using:
 

  * sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev
  * sudo apt-get install libpcre3-dev
  * sudo apt-get install libgnutls28-dev

 
Execute: tt++ to launch TinTin++
 


  Windows 95 and higher

An installer is available for download <http://tintin.mudhalla.net/
download.php> to install WinTin++, which exists of the mintty terminal
and the TinTin++ binary. WinTin doesn't have shell capabilities, but
otherwise WinTin is an excellent TinTin++ port that works on Windows 95,
98, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10 and 11.
 
WinTin is not to be confused with the less retro (or what some would
call more graphical) wintin.net or wintin 95 mud client. For people who
want an upgrade from wintin 95, the WinTin++ port is an excellent
alternative supporting most of the same features, except for some wintin
95 and wintin.net specific commands, as well as a lot of functionality
that has been added to TinTin++ and hence is available in the WinTin
port as well, like Perl Compatible Regular Expression support.
 
In order to run WinTin or TinTin++ in a linux environment on Windows you
need the Cygwin emulator which consists of two parts:
 

 1. A DLL (cygwin1.dll) which acts as a Linux emulation layer providing
    substantial Linux API functionality.
 2. A collection of tools, which provide Linux look and feel.

The Cygwin DLL works with all non-beta, non 'release candidate', ix86 32
bit versions of Windows since Windows 95, with the exception of Windows CE.
 
The size of Cygwin depends on how many packages you install, but
averages around 200 megabytes while WinTin is only 5 MB. If this appeals
to you, follow the instructions below to install Cygwin. Keep in mind
that WinTin doesn't have shell capabilities which means the #system,
#run, and #script command will not work. These commands can be used
under Cygwin for sub windowing, ssh, sftp, playing sounds, sending
emails, visiting websites, etc.
 

  * Create the directory named 'Cygwin' in the root of your C drive: C:
    \Cygwin.
  * Download setup.exe from http://www.cygwin.com/setup.exe to the
    Cygwin directory.
  * Launch setup.exe and click next
  * Choose 'install from internet' and click next
  * Use the default values, click next
  * Just use the default for the package directory, click next
  * Set your internet connection, click next
  * Select a download site, click next
  * You must select the correct packages now, select the following:
      o *Devel*: select gcc-core, make
      o *Editors*: select your favorite text editor, pico is easy to use
      o *Libs*: select libpcre-devel, zlib-devel, gnutls-devel
      o *Net*: select inetutils
      o *Net*: select openssh
      o *System*: select util-linux
      o *Web*: select wget
  * Click next and wait for cygwin to finish installation.
  * Download tintin.tar.gz (do not unzip it) to C:
    \Cygwin\Home\YourUsername\
  * Enter your shell (click the cygwin icon) and type:
    tar -zxvf tintin*.tar.gz
    cd tt/src/
    ./configure
    make
    make install
    tt++
  * The last command should startup TinTin++.
  * If for some reason you have trouble compiling TinTin++ you can
    instead install WinTin++, next copy tt++.exe from the WinTin++
    installation directory to the /bin directory in Cygwin.

  * Enjoy


  Windows 10 and higher

Please see the section on Windows 95 and higher for installing Cygwin or
WinTin++. As of Windows 10 it is possible to run TinTin++ using WSL
(Windows Subsystem for Linux). The biggest advantage of WSL,
particularly WSL 2, is performance. Installation instructions are as
following:
 

  * Use the search assistant to open the 'For Developers' setting and
    enable 'Developer Mode'.
  * Use the search assistant to open the 'Turn Windows features on or
    off' setting and turn on 'Windows Subsystem for Linux'
  * Use the search assistant to open the 'bash' application which should
    tell you to visit the WSL Store <https://aka.ms/wslstore> where you
    can download your favorite Linux distribution, with Ubuntu being the
    most convenient one.
  * Once Ubuntu is up and running use 'sudo apt-get update' and 'sudo
    apt-get install tintin++' to install TinTin++.
  * If you want to install the TinTin++ Beta version see the Ubuntu
    <#Ubuntu> installation instructions for details.
  * Download and use the Mintty WSL Bridge <http://tintin.mudhalla.net/
    download/Mintty_WSL_Bridge.msi> installer to use Mintty as your WSL
    Terminal instead of the Windows 10 Bash console.
  * Edit .bashrc and add 'cd' at the end of the file to automatically
    switch to your home directory when using Mintty WLC Bridge.
  * If you want to be able to execute Windows programs within WSL have a
    look at cbwin <https://github.com/xilun/cbwin>.
