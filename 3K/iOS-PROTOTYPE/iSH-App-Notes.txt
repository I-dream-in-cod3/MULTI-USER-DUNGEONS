Linux notes

The /etc/profile File
The /etc/profile contains Linux system wide environment and
 other startup scripts. Usually 
the default command line prompt is set in this file.


Relative path movement can be done using

cd ../../..

or cd ../bin/ 
etc. 
literally
cd ../etc/

Note: you need to be in a subdirectory with the same parent dir


0 = go to beginning probably similar to - but white space? idc rlly
$ = go to end including white space if possible
